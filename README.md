Acute Sender Web Portal Version 2.1: Website for sending/receiving images, pdfs...

##Welcome to Acuter Sender 2.0

The original idea aimed to provide a fast and modern solution to sending data between your devices without having to email yourself.
Using the mobile app you could send data that can be accessed on a website. As so, you could send data between your phone and PC.

Acute Sender 2.0 includes only the website but provides many features compared to the original such as:

- Being able to send all data types

- Recognized data types such as images and string are displayed on the website directly.

- PDF's are displayed using an embedded PDF viewer, other types of data are given a download link

- Creating an account to bypass having to use a key code for each data sent

- Extra secure option permitting sending data that's only accessible via sign in.

- Sending data with an expiration time span or password
